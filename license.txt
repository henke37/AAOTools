Give credit if you use this to build any software. You do not have to provide any credit if you just use it as a tool for editing trials.
Do not add any html import engine, there is no need to do so and would just be copyright violation bait.
No waranties are provided, if stuff breaks (where stuff includes this toolkit and anything touched by it), I have no obligations to fix it.
No selling this software.
No online redistrubution of this software, offline is ok.
Changed versions (as in the packaged files) may not be distrubuted at all without prior permission.
